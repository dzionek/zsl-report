# Accessible deep learning for camera trap data analysis

This is my final report after a research internship at ZSL and Imperial College London. Apart from the report itself, the repo also contains the deep learning model developed inside the paper.

The discussed software is a part of my different repo [dzionek/easyCT](https://github.com/dzionek/easyCT).

## Abstract
Camera trap surveys generate millions of images that are manually tagged by scientists. Machine learning
classifiers can significantly speed up this process, but they are hard to use for zoologists without technical
skills. EasyCT is a web application that aims to be accessible for people without coding expertise. It can
be run locally on any computer and read images stored on external hard drives. The application provides
insight into the distribution of photos over time and implements a single species classifier. The classifier
was found to give high accuracy classification on badgers (Meles meles). At the same time, it is quick
and can process four high-resolution photos per second on a mid-level computer. EasyCT shows the
potential to reduce the time-consuming process of tagging camera trap images. It is open-source and can
be expanded by the community to use different machine learning models.
